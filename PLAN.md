# PLAN

- [ ] **Phase 1: Backend Foundation**
  - [x] Bootstrap FastAPI application structure.
  - [x] Implement core data models.
  - [x] Set up database connection.
  - [ ] **API Endpoints & Error Handling**
    - [x] Implement `/health` endpoint for application status.
    - [x] Implement `/settings` endpoint for frontend configuration.
    - [x] Implement `/research` endpoint for submitting research requests.
    - [x] Implement `/sse` endpoint for real-time research updates.
    - [x] Implement global exception handling for FastAPI.
    - [x] Add comprehensive logging for all API endpoints.

- [ ] **Phase 2: Agent Implementation**
  - [x] Define agent roles and responsibilities.
    - [x] Refine `SectionResearcher` agent for focused research.
    - [x] Refine `ReportAssembler` agent for report generation.
  - [ ] Implement agent communication protocols.
    - [x] Implement robust inter-agent communication.
    - [ ] Integrate agents with the FastAPI backend.
  - [ ] **Agent Enhancements**
    - [ ] Integrate external search tools (e.g., DuckDuckGo, custom search).
    - [ ] Implement agent memory persistence (e.g., using Redis).
    - [ ] Add error recovery and retry mechanisms for agent tasks.
    - [ ] Implement agent state management for long-running tasks.

- [ ] **Phase 3: Frontend Integration**
  - [ ] Connect frontend to backend APIs.
    - [ ] Update frontend to consume `/health` and `/settings` endpoints.
    - [ ] Implement research request submission from frontend to `/research`.
  - [ ] Implement real-time updates with SSE.
    - [ ] Connect frontend to `/sse` endpoint for streaming research progress.
    - [ ] Display real-time research updates and final report on the frontend.

- [ ] **Phase 4: Testing & Quality Assurance**
  - [ ] **Unit Tests**
    - [ ] Write unit tests for all new API endpoints.
    - [ ] Write unit tests for agent logic and helper functions.
    - [ ] Write unit tests for utility functions.
  - [ ] **Integration Tests**
    - [ ] Implement integration tests for backend services (API + agents).
    - [ ] Implement integration tests for database interactions.
  - [ ] **End-to-End Tests**
    - [ ] Expand existing E2E tests to cover full research workflow.
    - [ ] Add E2E tests for error scenarios and edge cases.
  - [ ] **Code Quality**
    - [ ] Configure and run code linting (e.g., Black, Flake8).
    - [ ] Configure and run type checking (e.g., MyPy).
    - [ ] Ensure consistent code formatting.

- [ ] **Phase 5: Deployment & Operations**
  - [ ] **Containerization**
    - [ ] Create Dockerfile for the backend application.
    - [ ] Create Docker Compose configuration for local development.
  - [ ] **CI/CD**
    - [ ] Set up basic CI/CD pipeline (e.g., GitHub Actions) for testing.
  - [ ] **Monitoring & Logging**
    - [ ] Implement structured logging for production environments.
    - [ ] Add basic health checks and metrics.
  - [ ] **Configuration Management**
    - [ ] Refine environment variable handling for different deployments.

- [ ] **Phase 6: Documentation**
  - [ ] Generate OpenAPI/Swagger documentation for the API.
  - [ ] Create a `DEPLOYMENT.md` guide.
  - [ ] Create a `CONTRIBUTING.md` guide.
